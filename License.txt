===============================================================================================
This is a small library for the CraftBukkit minecraft-multiplayer server platform.

The library itself contains some niffty utilities that can be used by any developer.
Some of the utilities are:
1) A reflection framework; this part of the library is based-off the reflection framework
   used in BKCommonLib.

2) A small packet library (sending only). This is done with reflection so no NMS code is
   involved.

3) A BukkitServer and PlayerUtil class. The BukkitServer class can be used to get NMS or
   Craftbukkit classes by using BukkitServer.getNMSClass(<classname>); or
   BukkitServer.getCBClass(<classname>);. It also contains some methods to get the nms-package
   and craftbukkit package name.

   The PlayerUtil class can be used to convert a bukkit player to an EntityPlayer (nms).
   You can also use it to get a player's connection and this class is also used to send
   packet by using PlayerUtil.sendPacket(<player>, <packet>);
